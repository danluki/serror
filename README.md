# Simple error type for services

**Introduction**

This document describes a simple error type designed for use within services. It provides a structured approach to handling errors generated by your service and communicating them to consumers in a consistent and informative manner.

**Danger Zone**

**Internal Use Only**

This error type and its implementation are intended for **internal use only**. The specific API design and error handling mechanisms may undergo changes in the future to better suit evolving service requirements.

**API Subject to Change**

The structure and behavior of the error type might be subject to alterations as the service and its error handling needs mature. Consumers of this error type (other internal services) should be prepared to adapt to potential changes communicated through versioning or documentation updates.
